# Reliable-Supply-Network-Design-with-Customer-Preferences
This repository contains instances and codes used to generate the computational results in the paper titled "Reliable Supply Network Design with Customer Preferences" by Shakiba Eneyati and Osman Ozaltin.

Build main-benders.cpp with CPLEX (tested for v12.9) to obtain the benders.exe file.

Run the batch file run-benders-15216.bat to generate the computational results.

The paper includes the details about the computational experiment settings.
Please contact Osman Ozaltin at oyozalti@ncsu.edu if you have any questions.
